My ideas for tackling and segmenting this project.
- Finish up project proposal before committing to any code
- Initialize the interaction component. Decide which language to use for each part. Start with ensuring a proper flow of information.
- Next focus on file acceptance. Create a simple csv to plotly chart.
- Then work on Gurobi integration. 
- Work through the basic gurobi modeling-examples, fixing mistakes or adding features as needed to perform those tasks.
- Reassess

Notes:
%python -m pip install gurobipy - What happens when you try install the python package without a key, does it still work?

grbgetkey 3eddbbfd-5000-4e74-86a5-ec6fcbc9#### - run cmd command to setup license key, we can maybe run this for the user.

https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples - These project examples are what I am basing my intended functionality off of. Most of the problems are more complex than they need to be, but it provides a good idea for what types of problems a user might need solved.
