My ideas for tackling and segmenting this project.
- Finish up project proposal before committing to any code
- Initialize the interaction component. Decide which language to use for each part. Start with ensuring a proper flow of information.
- Next focus on file acceptance. Create a simple csv to plotly chart.
- Then work on Gurobi integration. 
- Work through the basic gurobi modeling-examples, fixing mistakes or adding features as needed to perform those tasks.
- Reassess
